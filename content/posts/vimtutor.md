> Base On : VIM  Tutor - Version 1.7

# Introduction

Vim is a very powerful editor that has many commands, too many to
explain in a tutor such as this.  This tutor is designed to describe enough of the commands that you will be able to easily use Vim as an all-purpose editor.

The approximate time required to complete the tutor is 25-30 minutes, depending upon how much time is spent with experimentation.

It is important to remember that this tutor is set up to teach by use. That means that you need to execute the commands to learn them properly. If you only read the text, you will forget the commands!

Now, make sure that your `Shift-Lock key` is **NOT depressed** and press the   `j`   key enough times to move the cursor so that [Lesson 1.1](#lesson-11-moving-the-cursor) completely fills the screen.

## Lesson 1.1:  MOVING THE CURSOR

   **To move the cursor, press the `h`,`j`,`k`,`l` keys as indicated.**

```
      ^
      k      
< h        l >     
      j      
      v
```

>Hint:
>
> - The h key is at the left and moves left.
> - The l key is at the right and moves right.
> - The j key looks like a down arrow.

 1. Move the cursor around the screen until you are comfortable.

 2. Hold down the down key (j) until it repeats.
     Now you know how to move to the next lesson.

 3. Using the down key, move to Lesson 1.2.
